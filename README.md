To replicate the project follow these steps:
-	Download the csv’s
-	Run the Python script                        (remember to change the folder path accordingly to your setting)
-	Execute the three “create” SQL files
-	Execute the three “bulk” SQL files    (remember to change the folder path accordingly to your setting)
-	Execute the SQL query 

I added a screenshot of the results’ query, just in case you have problems with replicating the process.

I used SQL Server to resolve this project. 

The little errors in the tables were modified in place with Notepad++.
